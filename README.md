# HNPES - Hacker News Previous Entry Search

*Procurando um readme em [PortuguÃªs](README.pt-BR.md)*

HNPES allows you to search for the current URL on Hacker News and view the top results directly from the extension's popup.

## History

Since i became a user of hackernews ( like ten or eleven years ago ) i used a bookmarklet to see if the URL i am browsing has already been submitted to hackernews:

```javascript
(function() {
    var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open("GET", "https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=" + encodeURIComponent(location.href), true);
   
    request.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if(request.readyState == 4 && request.status == 200) {
            var response = JSON.parse(request.responseText);
            
            if(response.nbHits > 0) {
                location.href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=" + response.hits[0].objectID;
            } else {
                alert("this url has not been submitted yet");
            }
        }
    };
    
    request.send();
})();
```

 Due to some CSP and CORS nonsense a lot of sites have been breaking this script, looking for solutions i found that the only way to bypass that is using a chrome extension ( A Browser extension, but i am a chrome user ), so that's what i did!
